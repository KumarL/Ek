Every console application that accepts inputs from user, has code to process the command line parameters. It usually validates it, and then makes it available for rest of the application to use it. If you write such console applications for a living, like me, you are going to realize soon that such work should rather be automated. This tool, Ek, tries to automate generation of such input processing code given only the usage string of that tool.
